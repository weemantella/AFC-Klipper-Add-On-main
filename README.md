## Installation

To install this plugin, you should have the following pre-requisites installed:

git clone https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On.git
cd AFC-Klipper-Add-On
./install-afc.sh
```

## Configuration (Automated)

The `install-afc.sh` script will automatically install the majority of the plugin for you. 

Prior to starting Klipper, please review the configuration located at `~/printer_data/config/AFC/AFC_Hardware.cfg` and ensure all pins are correct for your specific hardware.

Additionally, review the following files for any changes that may be required:

```

Next, please copy the appropriate `AFC_Hardware.cfg` template file from `~/AFC-Klipper-Add-On/templates` to `~/printer_data/config/AFC`
